## Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy

**Once you have created a Transactable Offer in the Marketplace, your next step in your partner journey is to Co-Sell with Microsoft.**

### What is Co-Sell?

**Co-Selling is any collaborative engagement between Microsoft and its partner ecosystem, including:**

- Building demand
- Sales planning
- Sharing sales leads
- Accelerating partner-to-partner selling
- Delivering marketplace-led commerce

**Co-Sell Ready Status** exposes your solutions to Microsoft sales teams. Co-Selling with Microsoft sales teams and Microsoft partners helps you reach a vast community of Microsoft-managed customers to collaborate on sales opportunities that accelerate your business growth.

**Azure IP Co-Sell eligibility** allows you to submit Co-Sell referrals for your offers to contribute toward customersâ€™ Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitments (MACC).

#### Co-Sell Ready Requirements

#### Verify Co-Sell Status

To verify the Co-Sell status of a solution, use the following steps:

  1. Sign into Partner Center and select Referrals.
  2. Select Co-Sell solutions.
  - You can verify the current Co-Sell status and incentive programs your solution is approved for in the grid.
  - You can alternatively select the solution name and open the pane to verify its current status (including if the status is currently under review).
