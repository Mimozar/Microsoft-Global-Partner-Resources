## Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy

**Once you have created a Transactable Offer in the Marketplace, your next step in your partner journey is to make your offer attractive to customers.**

### What is a MACC Eligible Offer?

#### The MACC Program

**The Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) Program** is for **[Transactable Offers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations#transact-overview)** that are published to the Commercial Marketplace. Marketplace purchases of Transactable Offers that are enrolled in this program contribute towards an organization’s Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC). Marketplace purchases that contribute towards a customer’s Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment are limited to Azure benefit-eligible offers and can only be used to purchase solutions that are primarily platformed on or extend Microsoft Cloud products or infrastructure.

#### Requirements for an Offer to be Enrolled in MACC

An offer must meet the following requirements to enroll in the MACC Program:

  - Transactable with a pricing plan greater than $0 USD
  - **Free and BYOL (Bring your Own License) Offers are NOT considered transactable**
  - Azure IP & Co-Sell eligible
  - Published live in the Commercial Marketplace
