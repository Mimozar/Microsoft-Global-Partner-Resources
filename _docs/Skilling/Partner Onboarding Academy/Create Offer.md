## Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy

**After creating a Microsoft Partner Center account and receiving your MPN ID, your next step in your partner journey is to Create an Offer.**

### Create an Offer in Partner Center

To Create an Offer, you must select the following:

- [Select a Listing Type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type)
- [Select an Offer Type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/publisher-guide-by-offer-type)
- [Select a Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/pricing-and-offers)
- [Submit Offer for review](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/review-publish-offer)

### Offer Listing Type Options

**An offer must have one of 4 different listing types:**

- [Free Trial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#free-trial): A free software license available for 30 to 120 days. Customers will be charged for applicable Azure infrastructure usage.
- [Test Drive](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#test-drive)
- [Contact Me](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#contact-me): A simple list of the offer which allows a potential customer to contact you. This is used to **[generate customer leads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads).**
- [Get It Now](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#get-it-now): The only way to **"Transact in Marketplace."** Must be one of the following licenses:
    - [Free](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#get-it-now-free): Not Marketplace Transactable
    - [Bring Your Own License (BYOL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#bring-your-own-license-byol): Not Marketplace Transactable
    - [Subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#subscription): Charge a flat fee for monthly or annual subscriptions
    - [Usage Based Pricing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#usage-based-pricing): Used to define custom or pre-defined billing metrics and rates (e.g., per vCPU, per seat, usage billing, etc.)
 
__PRO TIP__: Most partners start with the "Contact Me" offer when getting started.

### Offer Types

**The technical portion of an offer will fall into one of the following Offer Types:**

- [SaaS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/plan-saas-offer)
- [Azure Container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-containers)
- [Virtual Machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-virtual-machines)
- [Azure Applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/plan-azure-application-offer)
- [Dynamics 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-dynamics-365)
- [Managed Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/plan-managed-service-offer)
- [Consulting Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/plan-consulting-service-offer)
- [And more!](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/publisher-guide-by-offer-type#list-of-offer-types)

#### [Offer Type — SaaS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/plan-saas-offer)

To integrate your SaaS with the MP, here are a few, great resources to get started:

- [Mastering the Marketplace](https://microsoft.github.io/Mastering-the-Marketplace/saas/tech-topics/)
- [SaaS Accelerator](https://microsoft.github.io/Mastering-the-Marketplace/saas-accelerator/)

#### [Offer Type — Azure Container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-containers) 

- **[Azure Container Offers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/azure-container-technical-assets-kubernetes)** are for solutions which can run inside an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. Microsoft hosts your container images and helm chart, deploys them into a customer AKS cluster, and manages billing.

Reference this **[blog post](https://aka.ms/k8sapps)** for more details.

### Private vs Public Plans

When creating an offer, you may want to offer different pricing models for customers that are not yet publicly available. The different options:

- **[Private Plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/private-plans):** A custom pricing plan for an offer for a specific Tenant or Subscription.

- **[Private Offers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/isv-customer):** Similar to Private Plans, but cover more scenarios (e.g., discounts, expiration dates, bundles, custom terms). Note that a Private Offer still requires a Public Offer and a Public Plan with a price. The pricing and terms will be updated in the Private Offer.

A guide that compares the two options can be found **[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/isv-customer-faq).**

__PRO TIP__: When possible, use a Private Offer. Creating a Private Plan requires your offer to go through certification again and takes more time.
