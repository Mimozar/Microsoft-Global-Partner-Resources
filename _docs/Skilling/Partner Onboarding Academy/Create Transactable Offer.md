## Microsoft Partner Onboarding Academy

**Once you have created your first offer in the MP, your next step in your partner journey is to ensure that the solution is Transactable.**

### Fundamentals: Create a Transactable Offer

**[What is a Transactable Offer?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations#transact-publishing-option)** A Transactable Offer is one in which Microsoft facilitates the exchange of money for a software license on the publisher’s behalf. Transactable Offers are billed against an existing Microsoft Subscription or credit card, allowing Microsoft to host cloud marketplace transactions on behalf of the publisher.

To simplify, Transacting through the Marketplace means that **billing for your software goes through Microsoft instead of your own invoicing system.**

#### Transactable Offer Types:

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Azure Application — Managed application
- Azure Container
- Azure Virtual Machine
- Dynamics 365 Apps on Dataverse and Power Apps
- Dynamics 365 Business Central — Addon

### Pricing models

Different Offer Types have different billing options depending on the capabilities they offer. For full details see **[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations#pricing-models).**

In general, pricing models can be split into 3 categories:
- **Subscription:** Recurring subscription fee billed as a flat rate or per-seat
- **Metered:** Charge based upon application meters (e.g., emails processed, bandwidth)
- **Usage-based:** Charge based on use of the offer (e.g., per hour billing)
