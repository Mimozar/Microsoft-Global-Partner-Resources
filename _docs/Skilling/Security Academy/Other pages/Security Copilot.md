# Copilot for Security Technical Resources

## What is Copilot for Security? ðŸ¤”

Microsoft Copilot for Security is the first security product to enable defenders to move at the speed and scale of AI. It combines the most advanced large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI with large-scale data and threat intelligence, including more than 78 trillion daily security signals.

## Secure UpdateðŸ”“

It's been a busy week! As someone who began experimenting with Copilot for Security (CfS) nearly a year ago, it's rewarding to see not just a product, but a platform, excel expectations. CfS is truly an embodiment of what's possible. Most of the heroes behind it, and all their late nights, will never be widely known, but their work surely will.

#### Considerations

* **Assist a Human in Completing Work** â€“ It's a Copilot, integrations are driven by/drive human engagement, not background runtime processing of substantial amounts of data.
* **Have High Customer Value** â€” The cost of Generative AI is orders of magnitude higher per transaction than your average feature today and depends on a constrained hardware supply (GPUs).
* **Will be Regularly Used** â€” The best integrations will be used regularly so it is ongoing value, not a one-time value (like a configuration assistant).

#### How does Copilot for Security increase efficiency?
