# Security Copilot Resources

## What is Security Copilot? ðŸ¤”

We first introduced Security Copilot at the inaugural Microsoft Secure. Microsoft Security Copilot is the first security product to enable defenders to move at the speed and scale of AI. It combines the most advanced large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI with a Microsoft-developed, security-specific model.

Are you a Microsoft partner wanting to learn more about how to engage customers and take advantage of Security Copilot? If so, complete our **[Microsoft Security Copilot Partner Interest Form](https://forms.microsoft.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7GkZxmcvGdGql1aVgLqRR1UNEk0MTVPVjg1VjhPMUJHVTZETlRXSk1RQy4u)!**

If you have an existing NDA with Microsoft, join our [Microsoft Security Copilot Limited Customer Connection Program (CCP)](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR_XAVZ7AP_VPg7dX-69WxXdUQ1ZNUUVQOFNZOUtVSzdTNTFCMUEyQkVUQi4u).

## Features

* Incident Response â€” Summarize incidents, assess impact, and receive tailored remediation guidance based on proven strategies.
* Security Posture Management â€” Learn if your organization is at risk from vulnerabilities and examine resources in your environment for signs of a breach.
* Security Reports â€” Summarize investigations, incidents, vulnerabilities, or threats in minutes and prepare the information in ready-to-share reports.

#### Considerations

* **Assist a Human in Completing Work** â€“ It's a Copilot, integrations are driven by/drive human engagement, not background runtime processing of substantial amounts of data.
* **Have High Customer Value** â€” The cost of Generative AI is orders of magnitude per transaction higher than your average feature today and depend on a constrained hardware supply (GPUs).
* **Will be Regularly Used** â€” The best integrations will be used regularly so it is ongoing value, not a one-time value (like a configuration assistant).
* **Work with Constrained Context**Â â€” The model has a token limit for both input and output for the entire session.
* **Leverage Model Creativity** â€” The model is probabilistic and not deterministic; the best integrations are cases where that is additive to the user experience.
