sorttitle: 5
description: Defending a multicloud, multi-SaaS environment against modern threats can be challenging. You need the ability to "see your environment as your enemy sees it", understand what the threat landscape looks like, and respond quickly -- with a consistent approach every time. These are exactly the challenges we tackle in this session, which deals with External Attack Surface Management (EASM), Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (MDTI) and threat hunting with Jupyter Notebooks!
