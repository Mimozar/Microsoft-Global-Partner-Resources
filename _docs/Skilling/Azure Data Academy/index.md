Welcome to the Azure Data Academy. 

The Azure Data Academy is a series of presentations and hands-on material designed to upskill partners on data modernization in Microsoft Azure. Topics include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Maria DB, Cosmos DB, and other topics related to data modernization. Weâ€™ll look at features, migration strategies, and roadmap.

We've organized the content into a few key areas:
* [SQL Server and Data Integration](/PartnerResources/skilling/azure-data-academy/sql) - Content related to SQL Server (on premises and in the cloud), Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, and data movement & migration, ETL, ELT, etc.
* [OSS DB: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB](/PartnerResources/skilling/azure-data-academy/ossdb) - Content for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and similar databases; generaly referred to as OSS DB.
* [Cosmos DB](/PartnerResources/skilling/azure-data-academy/cosmosdb) - Content related to Cosmos DB -- this area has significant overlap with our Analytics Academy, and so some content may appear in both areas.
