In this video, we focus on the technical L100 details that you must know when working with ChatGPT and DALL·E 2. To understand ChatGPT better, we discuss the overall prompt format, demonstrate how to work with the chat playground in the OpenAI studio, and even cover how to use your own data with ChatGPT. DALL·E 2 fundamentals are demonstrated through examples and short visual demonstration. By the end, you will gain a understanding of how to implement the two in your own solutions.
