Last update: 6/17/2024

## How do I apply?

Only a Partner Administrator of an organization\'s Microsoft account can
apply for the AI and Machine Learning in Microsoft Azure specialization
on behalf of the organization. If you have the appropriate role and
access, you can apply by signing into [Partner
Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/membership/advancedspecialization/BuildAndAIAppASP)
and navigating to your Partner Center dashboard \> Membership \>

## What are the requirements?

Eligible partners must meet the highest standards for service delivery
and support. All requirements will be verified by Microsoft and/or a
third-party vendor, either automatically or by manual review, and are
subject to change.

### 1.  Solution Partner Designation

> Your organization must have an active Solutions Partner for Data & AI
> (Azure) or Digital & App Innovation (Azure) designation.
>
> **How to attain a Solutions Partner designation**The partner
> capability score provides flexibility to demonstrate knowledge,
> skills, and experience across subcategories of performance, skilling,
> and customer success.
>
> A minimum of **70** points must be earned, with points in each
> category. There are **100** points possible in total across
> categories.

-   Performance - Measured by net customer adds

-   Skilling - Verifies and demonstrates your dedication to skilling and
    training by intermediate and advanced certifications

-   Customer success - Measured by usage growth and the number of
    solution deployments

> Solutions Partner designations
>
> There are two paths to earning points:

-   Partner associations recognize partners for performance and customer
    success subcategories including net customer adds, usage growth, and
    deployment

-   Certified professional associations provide visibility into the
    certifications individuals in your company have earned

### 4.  Audit

Your company must pass a third-party audit.Â The [AI and Machine Learning
on Microsoft Azure specialization
audit](https://assetsprod.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-azure-ai-audit-checklist.pdf)
contains two (2) modules, **Module A**: Cloud Foundation and **Module
B**: AI and Machine Learning on Microsoft Azure workload.

-   **Module A** -- The Cloud Foundation module evaluates the use of a
    consistent methodology and process for Azure adoption that is
    aligned with customers' expected outcomes, spanning the entire cloud
    adoption lifecycle.

-   **Module B** -- The AI and Machine Learning on Microsoft Azure
    module validates that the partner has adopted robust processes to
    ensure customer success across all phases of deploying AI cognitive
    services and machine learning solutions, from the assessment phase
    to design, pilot, implementation, and postimplementation phases.

To pass the audit, you must complete all [audit
checklist](https://assetsprod.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-azure-ai-audit-checklist.pdf)
items. Below are a few key notes from the audit checklist document.
**Please reference the audit checklist document directly for the latest
information**.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Module A: Cloud Foundation is required for multiple Azure           |
| specializations**                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| -   The partner may present evidence of a previous pass result from   |
|     Module A or from another Azure specialization audit conducted on  |
|     V2.0 or later.                                                    |
|                                                                       |
| -   Partners who have passed an Azure specialization audit before     |
|     July 1, 2021 and for the Analytics on Microsoft Azure             |
|     specialization audit before Oct 1, 2021, have likely not passed   |
|     the Module A audit and will need to do so to qualify for the      |
|     Module B workload audits.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| **Module B: AI and Machine Learning on Microsoft Azure workload**     |
|                                                                       |
| -   Each control has one (1) or more requirements and required        |
|     evidence the partner must provide for the auditor.                |
|                                                                       |
| -   Both the requirements and the required evidence are defined in    |
|     the [audit checklist                                              |
|     tables](https://as                                                |
| setsprod.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-azure-ai-audit-checklist.pdf). |
|                                                                       |
| -   For some controls, a reference customer or customer evidence is   |
|     the documentation requested.                                      |
|                                                                       |
| -   Unless otherwise stated, the partner must show at least three (3) |
|     unique customers with deployments completed within the last       |
|     twelve (12) months.                                               |
|                                                                       |
| -   Please note some checklists call for four (4) customer examples.  |
|                                                                       |
| -   The partner can use the same customer across audit checklist      |
|     controls, or they can use a different customer. For audit         |
|     evidence relating to customer engagements, the partner can use a  |
|     customer case study and reference it multiple times. The same or  |
|     different customers can be used for Modules A & B if they         |
|     demonstrate requirements.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| You can use the same customer across audit checklist controls, or you |
| can use a different customer. For audit evidence relating to customer |
| engagements, you can use a customer case study and reference it       |
| multiple times. The same or different customers can be used for       |
| Modules A & B if they demonstrate requirements.                       |
