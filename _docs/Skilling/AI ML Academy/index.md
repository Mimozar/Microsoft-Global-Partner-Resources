# AI & ML Academy

> More coming soon! The AI & ML Academy is undergoing improvements.

## Content

Welcome to the AI and ML Academy (AIA)! This academy includes 6 modules, all of which are built on top of each other. It incorporates technical assets as well as best practices. We include common AI/ML scenarios that we have seen throughout various industries. The objective of the academy is to help you move faster and build effective solutions. The modules are:

{% include series.md 
    includetags="ai & ml academy|academy content|ai & ml academy module" 
    includemethod="all" 
    sortfield="sorttitle" sortorder="asc" showdate="false" showtags="false" 
    visualstyle="navlist" showdescrip="false" removetext="AI & ML Academy - " 
%}

## Events (April 2024 UpdateðŸ“°)

- AI Readiness events: **[AI & ML Partner Prep](https://aka.ms/AIMLPartnerPrep)**


## Table of Contents

The structure of the content is represented in the table below; the overview session is a high-level overview focusing on concepts and principles, while each of the 'module' sessions, Customizable AI through MLOps, will be more in-depth. Each session will contain one or more presentations, with several suggested labs and workshop content in each module designed to accommodate various skill levels and time availability.

Refer to links below for the module breakouts.

## Hands-on provisioned Environments

We are not currently offering fully hosted lab environments for the AI & ML Academy, but this may change in the future as we expand the content. In the meantime, you can still run the labs in your own Azure subscription. These labs are listed below:
