The Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Academy's **[Video Modules](/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-infrastructure-academy/modules)** are organized into four smaller infrastructure modules, including **[Migrate and Secure](/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-infrastructure-academy/windows-sql-servers)**, **[SAP on Azure](/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-infrastructure-academy/sap-on-azure)**, **[Enable Customer Success](/PartnerResources//skilling/microsoft-infrastructure-academy/enable-customer-success)**, and **[AI Infrastructure (HPC)](/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-infrastructure-academy/ai-infrastructure)**. These modules lay the foundation for developing proficiency in Azure infrastructure.

The resources within each academy are created and delivered by architects across the Global Partner Solutions (GPS) team and beyond, who are experts in their respective fields. Choose the modules that align with your areas of interest to expand your knowledge and enhance your skills.
