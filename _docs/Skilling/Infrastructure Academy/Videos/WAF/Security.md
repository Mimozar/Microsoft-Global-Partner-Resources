description: To defend against urgent threats, Microsoft gathers billions of signals from the security ecosystem to create contextual threat intelligence that is integrated into products such as Defender XDR, and Microsoft Sentinel. In this session, we’ll trace the journey of a single signal from its initial detection in the wild to the rules that protect you. We’ll also show you how to access these rules directly and customize them for your own needs.
