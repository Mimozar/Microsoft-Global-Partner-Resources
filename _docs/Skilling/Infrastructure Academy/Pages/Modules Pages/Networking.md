## Microsoft Networking Academy
Welcome to the Microsoft Networking Academy. Explore Azure Networking video sessions with demos delivered directly to partners, relevant certifications, and further resources.

> More coming this March! Our team is currently creating new networking videos. Please check regularly for updates.

## Azure Networking: The Art of The Possible and the *why* Series

The purpose of this repo is to deliver **layered, reusable and github friendly** network architecture diagrams for Cloud Solutions Architects to run effective Azure design and skilling sessions. The content is based on **real customer and partner design sessions** with collaboration from cross-functional architects. The repository will include tips and tools for effective story telling that explain the **why behind the design options based on requirements** and the art of the possible.  The design areas include - Azure Networking, Hybrid connectivity architectures, routing, firewalling, load balancing, multi-region, secure design, cross functional networking areas and AKS networking.   The networking complexity is broken down into **layers** with **one diagram** per design area using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) now [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/). This repo will include configuration snippets to reduce the lab prep time and the need to leave the labs running for demos.
