# {{ page.title }}

A marketing form is an inbound communication channel that allows your customers to register for newsletters, ask for quotations, etc. The form is defined by a set of input fields arranged into a form layout. Each marketing form is made from a collection of fields, buttons, graphical elements, and a few configuration settings. Each field included in your form is linked to an attribute of an entity.
