Triggers control the flow of trigger-based journeys. They represent customer actions such as a whitepaper download, a form submitted, or a Wi-Fi sign-up. Triggers can also represent significant business events, such as a purchase that has shipped or the completion of an enrollment process.

There are three types of triggers in the triggers catalog: custom triggers, interaction triggers, and business triggers.
