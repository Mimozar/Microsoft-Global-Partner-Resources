description: The Image Analyzer extension uses powerful image analytics provided by the Computer Vision API for Azure Cognitive Services to detect attributes in the images that you import for items and contact persons, so you can easily review and assign them. For items, attributes could be whether the item is a table or a car, and whether it is red or blue. For contact persons, attributes can be gender or age.
