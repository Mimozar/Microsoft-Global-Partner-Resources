sorttitle: 01 - D365 Copilot Academy - Microsoft Sales Copilot and Dynamics 365 Sales
description: This second video guides you through the demo. Once you have completed the configuration from Part I, you'll be able to easily demonstrate all the features of Microsoft Sales Copilot while integrated with Dynamics 365 Sales, Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Outlook. Copilot, in this integrated scenario, helps sellers dramatically reduce the time they spend on basic tasks. Copilot helps author email responses to customers and can create an email summary of a Teams meeting in Outlook. The meeting summary pulls in details from the sellerâ€™s CRM such as product and pricing information, as well as insights from the recorded Teams call.
