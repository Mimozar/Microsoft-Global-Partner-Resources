description: In this Partner Showcase, we discuss securing AI apps using Terraform and Vault with David Wright from HashiCorp. Terraform, of course, is the widely used infrastructure-as-code tool. In this demo, David walks though how to leverage Vault along with Terraform to deploy the demo app using a PKI architecture. This is a sneak peek at David's build session that further explores this topic!
