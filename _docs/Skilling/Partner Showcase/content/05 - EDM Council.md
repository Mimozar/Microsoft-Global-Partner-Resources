sorttitle: Microsoft Partner Showcase — EDM Council
description: We frequently talk about data management and data governance from a software and technical perspective, but what about the people and the processes that implement data management? How do you know if your data management is sufficient? Where do you start if don't have any data management framework or governance? These are questions the EDM Council, and specifically their CDMC framework, strive to answer. In this showcase, Mike Meriton, EDM Council cofounder, discusses the history of the EDM Council and the CDMC framework.
