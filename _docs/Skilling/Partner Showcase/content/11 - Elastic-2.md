sorttitle: Microsoft Partner Showcase — Elastic (Ep 2) Data Chunking
description: Continuing our Partner Showcase series with Elastic, this episode discusses data chunking, and how it relates to semantic search and natural language processing. Taking large documents and breaking them into smaller chunks of data (such as sentences or paragraphs) can improve semantic search by building vectors from these fragments. See how this applies in Elasticsearch in our "Too Much Turkey Tech Talk."
