# Developer Velocity Academy — DevOps

> More coming soon! This page is under development. Please check regularly for updates.

Welcome to the **Developer Velocity Academy — DevOps.**

{% include_relative pagenav.md %}

## Overview

**DevOps** is a software development approach that combines development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to streamline and automate the entire software delivery lifecycle. It focuses on breaking down traditional silos between development and operations teams, emphasizing collaboration, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous monitoring. By fostering a culture of shared responsibility and efficient processes, DevOps aims to accelerate software development, enhance its quality, and enable rapid and reliable releases.
