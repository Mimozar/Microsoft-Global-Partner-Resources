title: Getting Started with Data Science in Microsoft Fabric
description: Looking to get started with Data Science in Microsoft Fabric? In this session, we'll walk through how to get started by creating a Jupyter notebook, download sample data from our lab, create a ML forecast with Prophet, and cross-validate and evaluate the model. We'll then store the model in MLflow and see how to use it both in the notebook and in the Fabric workspace.
