# Modern Analytics Academy - Hands-on

In the hands-on section, we'll look at tutorials, labs, and hacks. 

## Fabric Specific Labs & Workshops

| Lab Name | Time | Content | 
|---|---|---|
| Real-time Analytics Lab | 4 hours | [Lab](https://aka.ms/fabricrealtime) |
| Real-time Analytics Hack | 8 hours | (coming soon) [Lab](https://aka.ms/wth) |

Our real-time analytics lab and hack will walk through a scenario of ingesting real-time data, storing it in a KQL database, develop reporting from the real time data, configure data activator for observability/alerting, and transform the data into a data warehouse from real-time data.
