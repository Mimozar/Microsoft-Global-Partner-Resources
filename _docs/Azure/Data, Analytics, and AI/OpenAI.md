# Learning Plan Resources for Azure OpenAI

## Introduction

Azure OpenAI is a collaboration between Microsoft Azure and OpenAI, a leading research organization in artificial intelligence.
It is a cloud-based platform that enables developers and data scientists to build and deploy AI models quickly and easily.
With Azure OpenAI, users can access a wide range of AI tools and technologies to create intelligent applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning.

Azure OpenAI is designed to accelerate the development of AI applications, allowing users to focus on creating innovative solutions that deliver value to their organizations and customers.

## Request Access

- Azure OpenAI: [Request Access to Azure OpenAI Service (microsoft.com)](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUOFA5Qk1UWDRBMjg0WFhPMkIzTzhKQ1dWNyQlQCN0PWcu)
- Rate Increase: [Azure OpenAI Service: Request for Quota Increase (microsoft.com)](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUMkkzRUlBMFBPT1ZQM01DODJNV1BEVENUTCQlQCN0PWcu)
- Form Recognizer Query: [Form Recognizer private preview access request (microsoft.com)](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUQTRDQUdHMTBWUDRBQ01QUVNWNlNYMVFDViQlQCN0PWcu)
- GPT4: GPT-4 and GPT-4-32k are now available to all Azure OpenAI Service customers. You no longer need to request access to use GPT-4 and GPT-4-32k. Availability is still currently limited by region to ensure a smooth rollout. You still need to apply for the AOAI Service if you do not have that already.
